# Contributing to this repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my Pseudocode Interpreter. There is endless space for improvement and all contributions are appreciated.

## Guidelines

- Use short, concise commit messages that start with a verb and are in the present tense
- Make sure grammar contributions use snake_case
- Try to avoid nesting where possible
- Use snake_case for identifiers and PascalCase for types in Rust (lints should appear if you don't)
- Use the [Pseudocode Reference](https://github.com/nouritsu/rs-pseudocode/blob/main/grammar/Pseudocode_Ref.pdf) to understand pseudocode syntax
- Use the [ENBF Reference](https://github.com/nouritsu/rs-pseudocode/blob/main/grammar/ENBF_ref.ebnf) to understand ENBF syntax
